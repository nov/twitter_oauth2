# TwitterOAuth2

Twitter OAuth2 Client Library in Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'twitter_oauth2'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install twitter_oauth2

## Twitter account setup

In order to use Oauth2 tokens generated by this gem to talk to the Twitter API, your Twitter Developer account needs to be set up as follows:

1. [Sign up](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/basic) for a twitter developer account (a [Free plan](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api) is sufficient)
1. Create a Project and an App in the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps)
1. Press the **Edit** button in the **User authentication set up** section of the **Settings** tab of your Twitter Developer app
1. In the _User authentication settings_ screen:
    1. Set **App Permissions** to **Read and Write**
    1. Set **Type of App** to **Web App, Automated App or Bot** _(otherwise, trying to access a token will fail with `invalid_request :: Value passed for the authorization code was invalid. (Rack::OAuth2::Client::Error)
`)_
    1. Set **App Info->Callback URI / Redirect URL** to any url, noting that when you run the authorization step below, authenticating the token will redirect to that URL and you will need to use the `code` query string parameter that is provided in the redirect to complete this script
1. Visit the **Keys and tokens** tab of your Twitter Developer app
1. Generate a _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ in the **OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret**
1. That _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ is used as `<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>` and `<YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET>` in the following Usage example

## Usage


```ruby
require 'twitter_oauth2'

client = TwitterOAuth2::Client.new(
  identifier:   '<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>',
  secret:       '<YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET>',
  redirect_uri: '<YOUR-CALLBACK-URL>'
)

authorization_uri = client.authorization_uri(
  scope: [
    :'users.read',
    :'tweet.read',
    :'offline.access'
  ]
)

# NOTE:
#  When `TwitterOAuth2::Client#authorization_uri` is called,
#  PKCE `code_verifier` and `state` are automatically generated.
#  You can get it here.

code_verifier = client.code_verifier
state = client.state

# When this step runs, you will need to be logged into your
# Twitter developer account in the web browser and you will
# be prompted to authorize. You will then be redirected by
# Twitter to the 'Callback URI / Redirect URL' specified in 
# the setup above and that redirection will contain a 'code'
# query string parameter. You will need to copy that code
# and use it in the next part of the script
puts authorization_uri
`open "#{authorization_uri}"`

print 'code: ' and STDOUT.flush
code = gets.chop

# NOTE: Obtaining Access Token & Refresh Token using Authorization Code
client.authorization_code = code
token_response = client.access_token! code_verifier

# NOTE: Refreshing Access Token using Refresh Token
client.refresh_token = token_response.refresh_token
client.access_token!
```

If you want to get App-only Bearer Token (via `grant_type=client_credentials`), you need some tweaks as below.

```ruby
require 'twitter_oauth2'

client = TwitterOAuth2::Client.new(
  # NOTE: not OAuth 2.0 Client ID, but OAuth 1.0 Consumer Key (a.k.a API Key)
  identifier:     '<YOUR-CONSUMER-KEY>',
  # NOTE: not OAuth 2.0 Client Secret, but OAuth 1.0 Consumer Secret (a.k.a API Key Secret)
  secret:         '<YOUR-CONSUMER-SECRET>'
  # NOTE: Twitter has Client Credentials Grant specific token endpoint.
  token_endpoint: '/oauth2/token',
)

client.access_token!
```

For more usage, read [the underling gem's wiki](https://github.com/nov/rack-oauth2/wiki).

## Token Usage with Twitter's V2 API

Once you have an access token from the above script (which you can find by inspecting the `access_token` property of the `token_response` variable in the script above before refreshing the token), you can use that token to talk to the Twitter V2 API.

```
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.twitter.com/2/users/me' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN>'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Free Twitter Developer Accounts

Free (ie. unpaid) Twitter Developer Accounts] are [only allowed to access]((https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/free)):

* **POST /2/tweets**
* **DELETE /2/tweets/:id**
* **GET /2/users/me**

If you try to access any other API endpoints, you will see an error like:

`
{"client_id":"8633235","detail":"When authenticating requests to the Twitter API v2 endpoints, you must use keys and tokens from a Twitter developer App that is attached to a Project. You can create a project via the developer portal.","registration_url":"https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects/overview","title":"Client Forbidden","required_enrollment":"Appropriate Level of API Access","reason":"client-not-enrolled","type":"https://api.twitter.com/2/problems/client-forbidden"}
`

## Background

This gem is built on `rack/oauth2` gem.   
Basically, the usage is same with [the underling gem](https://github.com/nov/rack-oauth2/wiki).

The only difference is that this gem is supporting PKCE as default, since [Twitter **requires** it](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/oauth2).

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
